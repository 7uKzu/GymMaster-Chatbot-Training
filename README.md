# **GymMaster – Exercise Muscle Group Classification using CNN**

GymMaster is a text-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify exercise titles into one of 11 primary muscle groups. Leveraging only exercise names, the model achieves high accuracy (98.44%) in predicting the targeted muscle group, demonstrating that short text contains sufficient semantic cues for biomechanical classification.

# Key Features:

Multi-class text classification for fitness exercises

Dataset: 14,590+ exercises across 11 muscle groups

Model: Custom Conv1D-based CNN for text sequences

Fast training with Google Colab GPU support

Visualizations for training history, confusion matrix, and classification performance

# Project Goals:

Enable fitness apps to automatically identify targeted muscles from exercise titles

Provide high-accuracy predictions for personalized workout guidance

Serve as a reference implementation for text-based CNNs in health and fitness AI
